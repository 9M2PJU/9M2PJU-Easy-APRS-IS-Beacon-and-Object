## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

This application requires **Python 3.8+**. To ensure a clean and isolated development environment, it's highly recommended to use a Python **virtual environment**.

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment and Installing Dependencies

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
    This command creates a new directory named `.venv` (a common convention) within your project, which will contain a private Python interpreter and package installations.

2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    Before installing dependencies or running the application, you need to activate the virtual environment.
    * **On Windows**:
        ```bash
        .\.venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        source ./.venv/bin/activate
        ```
    You'll typically see `(.venv)` or similar text appear in your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

3.  **Install Required Libraries**:
    With your virtual environment activated, install the necessary Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install `PyQt6` and `PyYAML` within your isolated `.venv` environment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Once your environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you're ready to go!

To launch the **graphical interface**:

```bash
python gui.py
````

To initiate **beaconing directly from the command line** (useful for automated setups):

```bash
python 9m2pju-aprs-beacon.py
```

## üõ† Configuration (`config.yaml`)

This crucial file is **auto-managed by the GUI**, making it incredibly easy to use. However, you can also fine-tune your settings manually if you prefer.

```yaml
callsign: 9M2PJU
passcode: 12970
latitude: 3.0738
longitude: 101.4457
comment: Main station 9M2PJU
symbol_table: /
symbol: r
interval: 10
dry_run: false
staggered: true

beacons:
  - name: DIGI01
    latitude: 3.1234
    longitude: 101.5678
    symbol_table: /
    symbol: "#"
    comment: Digi at hill
    interval: 15

  - name: REPEATER
    latitude: 3.1415
    longitude: 101.6789
    symbol_table: /
    symbol: R
    comment: 147.500MHz
    interval: 30
```

## üîê Important: APRS-IS Passcode

Your **APRS-IS passcode** is absolutely essential for successful transmission. This unique code is derived from your callsign and is used for authenticating with the APRS-IS network. If you don't have one, you can easily generate it using various **online APRS-IS tools or calculators**.
